Welcome to the Rexfro Find and Replace tool!
Too add a find and replace operation to the queue, enter it as follows into the Queue tab:

find,replace,replaceAll

where replaceAll is a boolean (type any of T,true,Y,1 / F,false,F,0), and find and replace are of
course the find and replace operations respectively. You can add as many of these operations as
you wish, where each operation is a new line (Exactly like a .csv file). Please ensure that any
spaces you add are in fact necessary to that specific operation! The find and replace tool uses
regular expressions, meaning that it has a significant increase in functionality over a regular
find and replace tool. However, this does mean that you mustn't forget about escape characters when
entering find and replace operations. You can save and load the queue as a json, csv, or tsv file.

You can add or load a new text file under the Text menu, which opens the corresponding text file as
a new tab. You can run the queue through all of the text files you have loaded, or run the queue on
an individual text file from those loaded. To run the queue on a new file, simply make a new file,
give it a new name (The name, nor the extension, do not matter if the file is not being saved), and
select the corresponding text file from the Run menu. If you decide to not run the queue on a text
file, you can remove it from the application through the Remove tab under Text. Note that this does
not delete the original file, so there's no need to worry about that.

**NOTE FOR TAs**
The A / V component is built into the error handling system. For example, if you have a bad queue,
an error will appear telling you to fix the queue before running it (hence bringing an instance of
the A / V component). Try keyboard smashing into the Queue box, and then select Run -> Run On All
(it does not matter if there is a text item loaded or not, the error will still show).
